## Description

This is my personal portfolio website built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Three.js. It showcases my projects, skills, and provides a glimpse into my journey as a developer.

## Features

- **TypeScript:** The project is written in TypeScript, providing a statically-typed and more maintainable codebase.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling is done using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to design responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

- **Three.js:** The graphics and interactive elements are powered by Three.js, a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics.

- **Next.js:** The website is built on the Next.js framework, providing server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and a great development experience.
